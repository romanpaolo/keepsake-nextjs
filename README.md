## Development

### Adding New Filters
1. Add filter type to `PhotoFilter` union in `lib/types.ts`
2. Implement filter function in `lib/filters.ts`
3. Add to filter selection in `ControlPanel.tsx`

### Customizing Themes
1. Update theme colors in `tailwind.config.ts`
2. Modify theme-specific styles in `app/globals.css`
3. Adjust component logic in theme-aware components

## Performance Tips

- Real-time filtering is optimized for 30fps+ on modern devices
- Canvas operations use requestAnimationFrame for smooth playback
- Photo strip generation is async to prevent UI blocking
- All processing happens client-side (no network overhead)

## Known Limitations

- Some filters may be less performant on older devices
- Camera requires HTTPS in production (except localhost)
- Photo strip export quality depends on device screen resolution
- Mobile devices may have varying camera access permissions

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add more Apple themes (Newton, iPod, MacBook)
- [ ] Custom photo frames and borders
- [ ] GIF creation from burst mode
- [ ] Social media sharing
- [ ] Audio/video recording
- [ ] More vintage filters
- [ ] Easter eggs and hidden features
